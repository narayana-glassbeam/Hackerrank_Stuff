/*The Euler's totient of a positive integer n is the number of positive integers not greater than n that are relatively prime to n (i.e. their greatest common divisor equals 1).
In this challenge, your task is to write a function that computes the Euler's totient of a given number.

Example

eulersTotient(2) = 1
1 is the only number relatively prime to 2.
eulersTotient(1) = 1
1 is the only number relatively prime to 1.
eulersTotient(10) = 4
The following numbers are relatively prime to 10: 1, 3, 7 and 9.
[input] integer n

A positive integer, 1 â‰¤ n < 109.

[output] integer

Euler's totient of n.*/
