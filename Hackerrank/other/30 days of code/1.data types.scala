/*Problem Statement

Welcome to Day 1! Check out the video tutorial here, or just jump right into the problem.

Let's talk about data types. In programming, a data type is a classification of types of data that determine the possible values and operations on that particular type.

Some typical examples of data types are:

int
double
boolean
char
String
Array
Remember, in languages like Java data types (like the ones above) can be classified into two main groups:

Primitive Types
Reference Types
For this challenge, consider the following inputs (you don't need to read any input):

5.35
'a'
false
100
"I am a code monkey"
true
17.3
'c'
"derp"
For each line above, print out if it is an instance of a primitive or referenced type as well as which data type it is (using the typical examples above).

Good luck!

Hint: In Java, String is a referenced type.

Output Format

Output nine lines. Print one line for each of the input given above in the following format:

MainDataTypeOfInstance : SpecificDataTypeOfInstance*/
