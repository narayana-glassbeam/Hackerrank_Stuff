/*Problem Statement

Pentagonal numbers are the number of dots that can be shown in a pentagonal pattern of dots. Let's represent the nth pentagonal number by P(n). The following figure depicts pentagonal patterns for n âˆˆ {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}.

Your task is to find the value of P(n) for a given n.

Input
The first line will contain an integer T, which represents the number of test cases. Then T lines, each representing a single test case, follow. Each test case contains an integer n.

Output
For each test case, print the nth pentagonal number, P(n), in separate line.

Constraints
1 <= T <= 105
1 <= n <= 105*/
